        Interactive coding lessons can be found on the website Codecademy. It is intended to provide hands-on, interactive programming and coding instruction. The platform is appropriate for both novices and those wishing to increase their coding expertise because it covers a broad range of programming languages and technologies. Because it is easy to use even for beginners and allows you to learn coding without installing any software, Codecademy is well-liked.

        Even though Codecademy offers a strong foundation, students frequently find that it is helpful to supplement their education with other materials and practical projects in order to further their comprehension of coding concepts.
