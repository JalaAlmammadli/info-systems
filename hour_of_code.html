        <h1>Hour of Code Event</h1>
        <p>On November 6, at 09:45 AM, at Yukhari Mollu Village Secondary School of Gubadli District, as Group 33, we held our Hour Of Code event dedicated to Computer Science Week on December 4-10. The members of our group are Asad Rzayev, Fatima Abdullazade, Fidan Abdullazade, and Jala Almammadli.</p>
        <p>Our event participants were 20 students of 7-8 grades. During the Hour of Code event, we informed the students about ADA University and used online exercises from the Code.org website. In the end, we awarded the students a certificate for their active participation. Using the Code.org web page, we showed that they could learn the basics of computer science while having fun.</p>
