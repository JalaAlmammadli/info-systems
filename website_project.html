      Interactive coding lessons can be found on the website Codecademy. It is intended to provide hands-on, interactive programming and coding instruction. The platform is appropriate for both novices and those wishing to increase their coding expertise because it covers a broad range of programming languages and technologies. Because it is easy to use even for beginners and allows you to learn coding without installing any software, Codecademy is well-liked.

      Even though Codecademy offers a strong foundation, students frequently find that it is helpful to supplement their education with other materials and practical projects in order to further their comprehension of coding concepts.

      As Team 33, we had a project to create a website. With the help of Codecademy, we learned 3 programming languages and applied these languages to our website project.
